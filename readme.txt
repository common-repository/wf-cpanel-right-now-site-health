## Known limitations

- Requires PHP `shell_exec¬¥ to be available
- Reports data from your own cPanel¬Æ server, not remote
- Reports data from your cPanel¬Æ server, all sites and all other web or cPanel¬Æ applications, in case more than your WordPress is installed on it
- Links to documentation to resolve reported issues are shown to PRO ISP AS customers only.
- This plugin will not show much if the site is not on a cPanel¬Æ managed server, but will do the test for HTTPS only.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin add database tables, store options, scheduled tasks or writing to `wp-config.php`? =

No, not, none, no.

= Does it require my login information to cPanel¬Æ? =

No.

= Does work if ¬¥shell_exec¬¥ function is disabled in PHP? =

No.

= What if I don't want the cPanel¬Æ Resource Usage widget (gauges)?

Close it with the up arrow icon, or hide it using Screen Options (the top right hidden panel) - as usual. No data will be fetched from cPanel¬Æ while widget is closed or hidden.

= Does it work on other web hosts than PRO ISP? =

Yes, should work on any cPanel¬Æ hosting.

= Does it work without cPanel¬Æ? =

Very, very limited. The 'HTTPS only' security test should work, and disk used info, but max space test will not be performed and the result will just show 'N/A'.

= Can I contribute to this plugin? =

No longer. Please see [WebFacing‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì cPanel¬Æ Email Accounts management &amp; Account backup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wf-cpanel-email-accounts/) 

= Can I donate to the continued maintenance and further development of this plugin? =

No. Use the Donate button in the right sidebar on the other recommended plugin page.
